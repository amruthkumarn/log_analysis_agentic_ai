## Service Dependencies
- 3scale API Gateway depends on TIBCO BusinessWorks for backend processing
- TIBCO BusinessWorks connects to multiple databases and external services
- Services communicate via REST APIs and JMS queues

## Normal Behavior Patterns
- API Gateway response times: < 200ms
- Database connection pool utilization: 20-80%
- JMS queue size: < 1000 messages
- Error rate threshold: < 1%

## Known Issues
1. Database Connection Issues
   - Symptoms: Connection timeouts, pool exhaustion
   - Impact: Service degradation, increased latency
   - Resolution: Increase pool size, implement connection retry

2. Rate Limiting
   - Symptoms: 429 errors, increased latency
   - Impact: Service unavailability
   - Resolution: Adjust rate limits, implement circuit breaker

3. JMS Queue Issues
   - Symptoms: Queue size warnings, message processing delays
   - Impact: Message loss, processing delays
   - Resolution: Scale consumers, optimize message processing
