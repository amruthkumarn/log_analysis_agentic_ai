# Troubleshooting Guide and Known Issues

This document provides troubleshooting steps and recommendations for common issues encountered in the system.

## General Troubleshooting Approach

1.  **Identify the Session:** Start by isolating the `session_id` for the affected user or transaction.
2.  **Trace the URC/UID Chain:** Follow the API call chain from the root URC.
3.  **Examine Error Messages:** Look for ERROR and WARN level logs within the session's context.
4.  **Correlate Timestamps:** Note the timing of errors and related events.
5.  **Check Component Health:** Verify the status of involved services (API Gateway, Payment Service, Tibco).

## Common Error Types and Patterns

### 1. Rate Limit Exceeded

*   **Error Code/Keywords:** `rate_limit_exceeded`, `Rate limit exceeded`
*   **Description:** The system has rejected a request because the client or service has made too many requests within a given time window.
*   **Observed In Logs (Examples):**
    *   `[ERROR] 3scale API Gateway: Rate limit exceeded for service_id=123, client_id=client_456, limit=1000, current=1200`
    *   `[ERROR] payment_service: Rate limit exceeded URC=child2 transaction_type=notify, severity=CRITICAL`
*   **Potential Root Causes:**
    *   Sudden spike in legitimate traffic.
    *   Misconfigured client making too many calls.
    *   Denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
    *   Rate limits set too low for normal operational load.
*   **Troubleshooting & Recommendations:**
    1.  **Identify the Source:** Determine which client, service, or IP is exceeding the limit.
    2.  **Analyze Traffic Patterns:** Check if the spike is legitimate or suspicious.
    3.  **Review Rate Limit Configuration:** Verify if the configured limits are appropriate for the service and client.
    4.  **Client-Side Optimization:** Advise client developers to implement caching, exponential backoff, or optimize API call frequency.
    5.  **Adjust Limits (if necessary):** If traffic is legitimate and sustained, consider increasing rate limits.
    6.  **Security Measures:** If a DoS attack is suspected, implement IP blocking or other security measures.

### 2. Authentication Failed

*   **Error Code/Keywords:** `authentication_failed`, `invalid_credentials`, `token_expired`, `unauthorized`
*   **Description:** The system could not verify the identity of the user or service making the request.
*   **Observed In Logs (Examples):**
    *   `[ERROR] 3scale API Gateway: Authentication failed for service_id=123, invalid credentials, client_id=client_456`
    *   `[ERROR] payment_service: Invalid authentication token URC=req125 transaction_type=transfer, severity=MEDIUM`
*   **Potential Root Causes:**
    *   Incorrect username/password or API key.
    *   Expired token or credentials.
    *   User account locked or disabled.
    *   Issues with the authentication provider or identity service.
*   **Troubleshooting & Recommendations:**
    1.  **Verify Credentials:** Ask the user/client to double-check their credentials.
    2.  **Check Token Validity:** Ensure API keys or tokens are not expired or revoked.
    3.  **Inspect Authentication Service Logs:** Look for more detailed errors in the logs of the authentication provider.
    4.  **User Account Status:** Confirm the user account is active and not locked.
    5.  **Credential Rotation:** Remind users/clients about secure credential management and rotation policies.

### 3. Backend Service Timeout / Health Check Failed

*   **Error Code/Keywords:** `backend_service_timeout`, `health_check_failed`, `status=503`, `connection_timed_out`
*   **Description:** An upstream or dependent service is not responding in a timely manner or is reporting as unhealthy.
*   **Observed In Logs (Examples):**
    *   `[ERROR] 3scale API Gateway: Backend service timeout for service_id=123, URC=root123, timeout=5000ms`
    *   `[ERROR] 3scale API Gateway: Backend service health check failed for service_id=123, status=503`
*   **Potential Root Causes:**
    *   The backend service is down or overloaded.
    *   Network connectivity issues between the caller and the backend service.
    *   Misconfigured timeouts (too short).
    *   Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk) on the backend service.
    *   Deployment issues or bugs in the backend service.
*   **Troubleshooting & Recommendations:**
    1.  **Check Backend Service Status:** Directly verify the health and logs of the reported backend service.
    2.  **Test Network Connectivity:** Use tools like `ping` or `curl` from the calling service to the backend service if possible.
    3.  **Review Backend Service Load:** Check metrics for CPU, memory, and network traffic on the backend.
    4.  **Increase Timeouts (cautiously):** If backend services are occasionally slow but recover, slightly increasing timeouts might be a temporary workaround, but the underlying slowness should be investigated.
    5.  **Implement Circuit Breakers:** Ensure circuit breakers are in place to prevent cascading failures.
    6.  **Investigate Backend Service Logs:** Look for specific errors or performance bottlenecks in the backend service's own logs.

### 4. Database Connection Pool Exhausted

*   **Error Code/Keywords:** `database_connection_pool_exhausted`, `connection_pool`
*   **Description:** The application cannot obtain a connection to the database because all available connections in the pool are currently in use.
*   **Observed In Logs (Examples):**
    *   `[WARN] payment_service: Database connection pool exhausted URC=child2 UID=child1, pool_size=100`
*   **Potential Root Causes:**
    *   High application load leading to many concurrent database requests.
    *   Connection leaks in the application code (connections are opened but not closed).
    *   Insufficiently sized connection pool configured for the application.
    *   Long-running database queries holding connections for extended periods.
*   **Troubleshooting & Recommendations:**
    1.  **Monitor Pool Usage:** Check application metrics for active vs. idle connections in the pool.
    2.  **Code Review for Leaks:** Inspect application code to ensure database connections are properly closed in `finally` blocks or using try-with-resources constructs.
    3.  **Optimize Queries:** Identify and optimize slow or long-running database queries.
    4.  **Adjust Pool Size:** If load is genuinely high and there are no leaks, consider increasing the maximum connection pool size. This should be done in conjunction with database capacity planning.
    5.  **Implement Connection Timeout:** Configure a timeout for acquiring a connection from the pool to prevent indefinite waits.

## System Architecture Notes for Troubleshooting

*   **API Gateway (3scale):** Entry point for external API calls. Issues here can relate to authentication, rate limiting, or connectivity to backend services.
*   **Payment Service:** Handles payment-related transactions. Depends on database connectivity and potentially other internal services.
*   **Tibco BusinessWorks (Conceptual):** Often used for integration and orchestration. If involved, check its logs for processing errors or delays in workflows.
*   **Inter-Service Communication:** Primarily via APIs. Look for errors related to request/response handling between services.
